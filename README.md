# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Superstore dataset

It is my first EDA project in the Retail field. It contains deep insights into the sales and profit of the Superstore in order to increase revenue. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
It can be further breakdowm into the following Analysis hierarchy-
1. Univariate Analysis: It involves determining the statistics of a single variable in hand example, mean, median, mode, spread of the variable, etc.
2. Bivariate Analysis: It tells the relationship between 2 variables, gives ideas for feature engineering and feature selection and also helps in hypothesis evaluation.
3. Multivariate Analysis: It provides the high level overview of the data and can analysis granular details about multiple features in the data.

Thought Process: 
I have divided the report of the dataset into 3 levels:
1. ### Region
2. ### Category 
3. ### Segment
